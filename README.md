# MMM_gtasks

This is an extetion fro MagicMirror. It shows your google tasks from your default calendar.

Warning: This is my first attempt at using node.js. I could be passing your google tasks credentials about the network in plaintext, so anyone on your local network could see a read-only copy of your google tasks. If you have your secret plans for world domination on your google to-do list, I would advise against the use of this module.
